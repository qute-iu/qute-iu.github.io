  Quantum Technologies for Everyone is a student run organization for bringing together people interested in quantum information science from a variety of academic fields and disciplines. 
  We are a team comprised of students that represent the growing IU Quantum Science and Engineering Center. Our mission is to equip the future quantum workforce with the skills necessary 
  in the field of QIS. Furthermore, we strive to continue to make industrial connections and remain on the cutting edge of quantum information science and engineering.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>We are inclusive of everyone interested in getting involved in the quantum information science and engineering (QISE) field.</li>
    <li>We are to be respectful of other peoples ideas or questions, operating under the assumption that everyone is coming from different backgrounds and different areas of expertise.</li>
    <li>The club thrives off member engagement, please try to participate and stay connected which will help gauge our members more technical interests.</li>
    <li>This organization provides an oppurtunty to learn, represent Indiana University, and develop the skills necessary for signifigant contributions in the QISE field.</li>
