    <li><b>June-27-2024:</b> Recent paper from one of our own Executive Board members!</li>
    <br>
    <p>QuTE secretary, Anurag Dwevedi had a paper realeased on <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.05197">arXive</a> on quantum nuclear dynamics using ion trap quantum computing hardware. </p>

    <li><b>April-17-2024:</b> Measurment induced heating paper on arXive!</li>
    <br>
    <p>Find arXive link <a href="https://iontrap.physics.indiana.edu/papers/Rasmusson2024.pdf">here</a>. Heating is detrimental to the operation of trapped ion quantum computing hardware. A most well known source of this heating, 
    often reffered to as "anamolous heating", heavily dictaces the entirety of the trap design and fabrication process. This paper is a study from a different kind of heating source, which is induced
    by the measurement of a trapped ion quantum state. </p>
