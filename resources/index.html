  <h3>Getting Started:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Quantum Country:</b> <a href="https://quantum.country/">https://quantum.country/</a></li>
    <br>
    <p>Free introduction to quantum mechanics and quantum computing. A collection of essays that provide a detailed introduction to basic principles in QIS as well as a few of its applications. 
    Only requires basic familiarity of linear algebra and complex numbers.</p>
    <li><b>IBM Quantum Learning:</b> <a href="https://learning.quantum-computing.ibm.com/">https://learning.quantum-computing.ibm.com/</a></li>
    <br>
    <p>Courses and tutorials for learning the basics of quantum computing using IBM Quantum services and systems. Qiskit is IBM's quantum software development kit and can be used to interact and program with IBMs superconducting harware. </p>
